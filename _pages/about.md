[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://ralobos.github.io/files/CV_RLOBOS_OCT_2023.pdf)

My research interests include medical imaging, tomography, nonparametric estimation, and inverse problems, with current and past projects in X-ray CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, radiation therapy, and image registration. I am interested both in developing algorithms for these problems, as well as analyzing and predicting the properties of these algorithms. My group works on a wide variety of imaging projects, both for medical imaging and some non-medical imaging problems. For a snapshot of our current research, see recent preprints under the "publication" link above.
